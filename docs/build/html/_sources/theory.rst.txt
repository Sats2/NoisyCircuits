Theory
=======

This section aims to provide a conceptual overview to quantum computing, qubits, the operator-sum representation for noise channels, and the Monte-Carlo Wave Function (MCWF) method. It is intended for readers who are new to quantum computing and quantum noise, and serves as a foundation for understanding the implementation details discussed in other sections of this documentation.
