Quantum Circuit Simulators
===============================

For most research works in quantum computing, quantum circuit are simulated on a classical computer rather than a quantum computer. This is because quantum computers are still in their infancy, and access to them is limited. Therefore, quantum circuit simulators play a crucial role in the development and testing of quantum algorithms and protocols. They allow researchers to model and analyze the behavior of quantum circuits, including the effects of noise and errors, without the need for physical quantum hardware. There are primarily two types of quantum circuit simulators: statevector simulators and density matrix simulators.

Statevector Simulators
-----------------------
A statevector simulator represents the quantum state of the system as a single pure state in a complex vector which stores the amplitudes of all the basis states. This state is evolved using unitary operations corresponding to quantum gates. This type of simulator is suited for ideal (or noiseless) quantum circuit simulations. Statevector simulators are computationally efficient for simulating small to medium-sized quantum systems, as the statevector size grows exponentially with the number of qubits. The memory requirement for storing the statevector scales as :math:`\mathcal{O}(2^n)` where :math:`n` is the number of qubits, while the computational time complexity scales as :math:`\mathcal{O}((2^n)^2)` due to the operations purely being matrix-vector multiplications.

Density Matrix Simulators
-------------------------
A density matrix simulator represents the quantum state of the system using a density matrix, which can describe both pure states and mixed states. This is particularly important for simulating noisy quantum circuits, where the system may not be in a pure state due to interactions with the environment. The density matrix formalism allows for the inclusion of noise channels and decoherence effects using the operator-sum representation. The memory requirement for storing the density matrix scales as :math:`\mathcal{O}(4^n)`, where :math:`n` is the number of qubits, while the computational time complexity scales as :math:`\mathcal{O}((4^n)^3)`. Due to this exponential growth, density matrix simulators are typically limited to simulating smaller quantum systems compared to statevector simulators, being capped at about :math:`16` qubits for practical simulations. While density matrix simulators are more computationally intensive, they provide a more accurate representation of real-world quantum systems by accounting for noise and decoherence.
